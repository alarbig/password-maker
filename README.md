# password-maker

- This is a password generator using Java, CSS and HTML. It will prompt you with several questions about what you would like included in your password. Such as symbols, uppercase letters and what length you want the password to be.
- The password will display your input prompts with a window alert. I know not the most exiciting option, but it will read those selections and output a password for you. You can select a length between 8-128 characters. 

- These are few of the screenshots that show the basic functionality of the page. It will display the ouput into a nice section where you can copy can paste.
